    <h3>Is there any documentation available?</h3>
    <p>Sure! Detailed is available on our site. If it doesn't help <a href="#" class="open-beacon">contact our friendly support</a>.</p>
    <p class="small">Quick Reminder: You should avoid creating pages that have very close slug structure like <b>contact</b> and <b>contact2</b> since it is not a good practice and the redirect will go to the first similar one alphabetically.</p>
